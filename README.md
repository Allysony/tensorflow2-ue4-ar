 # Project Scope
 Integrating TensorFlowâ€™s pose estimation model with tensorflow-ue4 plugin and AR core from Unreal, with all custom implementation
 
 # Current Limitations and Reasons for Custom Implementation
 - No object detection / body tracking with Google AR Core for Android and IOS
 - Tensorflow-ue4 plugin set for TensorFlow 1.12 not TensorFlow 2.5, thus incorrect API calls

# Project Goal Example
An augmented reality mobile app that allows users to preview any article of clothing on themselves with pose estimation tensorflow model and assets being created during run time.
